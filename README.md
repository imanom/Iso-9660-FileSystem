# ISO 9660 File System

Explores ISO 9660 file systems and loads the kernel file into memory using low-level Block I/O operations which reads 2KB raw blocks. Block I/O provides a low level implementation to read a file regardless of the file system type. 

## C 
This folder includes an implementation in C to traverse through an ISO file (ISO 9660 File Systems) and prints out relevant information such as file names and sizes. Can be extended to print other information.

### How to run?
- Path to the iso file has to be provided in `main.c` and `isoMethods.c` in the function `check_kernel_file()`.
- Navigate to base folder and run `make`.
- Then run `./main` to execute the program.

## UEFI
This folder includes an implementation to perform higher-level operations (reading a file) using the low-level block I/O operations in UEFI. This code reads the ISO file (ISO 9660 file system), and loads the kernel into memory. 

### Tools:
- build-essential, clang, lld, mkisofs, virtualbox. (install with `sudo apt install`)
- Clone this repository - https://github.com/rusnikola/fwimage in the same folder where `Code` and `Include` folders are present.
- VirtualBox

### How to run?
- Navigate to `UEFI/Code` folder and run make.sh which creates `boot.iso`.
- Load the `boot.iso` into a virtual machine in VirtualBox with UEFI enabled.
